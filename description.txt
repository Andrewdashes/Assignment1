My name is Andrew Le, and I am a second-year Managerial Economics major looking to minor in Japanese and Statistics. I want to learn how to manage a large amount of data as well as how to gain insightful analysis from it. Since there is so much data available in the world now, I want to be able to recognize how I can find the most pertinent data for any study I decide to pursue in the future. Additionally, I want to challenge myself to see if fields related to statistics and/or data science interest me. In my free time, I like spending time with friends and listening to music.
